### Hey!👋

## About Me
My name is Raphael! I was born in 2005 meaning I just turned 18! I'm Canadian and still live there 🍁. I also love Basketball ^^!




## My Programming Journey
I started coding back in the summer of 2018 for fun. I started off with Python before going for C++ a few months later. I also ended up learning some Unity C# and some of the .NET framework. So far, all of my scripting and coding experience was self-thaught, but I am planning on getting some kind of degree somewhere to sharpen my skills even more. My dream job is to be a programmer. Some things are a bit more fun to code than others, but as long as I code, I never get bored of solving problems ^^! I'm also a huge fan of maths and love to learn. I love improving as well, so if you'd like to criticize my code constructively, then you're more than welcomed!
